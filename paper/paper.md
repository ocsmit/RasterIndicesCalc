# Summary 
The public availability of multispectral satellite imagery combined with the high temporal frequency with which it is taken allows for imagery to be incorporated into many aspects of research.
The uses of indices derived from remote sensing products range from tracking vegetation health, monitoring forest canopy, observing water levels, fire detection, and even aiding in the creation of land cover datasets [@Silleos:2006; @Joshi:2006; @Ghulam:2007; @Roy:2006; @Jin:2013].
Indices are computed through the application of algebraic formulas where the inputs are either the spectral bands or other ancillary information from multispectral imagery.
However, outside of raster calculator Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's), like those in proprietary geospatial softwareâ€™s such as ArcGIS [@Esri:2020] and ERDAS Imagine [@Erdas:2004], and in the open source QGIS [@QGIS:2019], there is currently no streamlined method for calculating these indices.

The goal then of Rindcalc is to provide an efficient and seamless processing library capable of working directly with remote sensing products outside of a GUI and remove the need to set up a complex Python pipelines otherwise.
The indices and composites computed with Rindcalc can subsequently be added to other workflows and algorithms to aid in research.

Rindcalc is separated by remote sensing product with functionality for Landsat-8 [@Roy:2014], Sentinel-2 [@Drusch:2012], and National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) [@USDA:2020] provided at the time of writing.
For each remote sensing product a class is initialized which will read the filepaths of each raster band within the image directory utilizing the default naming conventions of each product. 
Each class contains two main dictionary attributes, `paths` and `bands`, both of which follow the same naming convention where the key for each band is titled "band_band#", e.g. band seven of Landsat-8 would be identified with the key "band_7". 
This naming convention is utilized throughout Rindcalc and effectively simplifies the process reading the individual bands.
Furthermore, the usage of the dictionary structure allows the data to be easily queryable and allows for only the desired bands to be loaded as arrays in order to reduced memory usage.
Spatial information for the imagery is maintained with the use of the Geospatial Data Abstraction software Library (GDAL) [@GDAL:2020] to convert bands to and from NumPy arrays [@Van:2011].
Additionally, processing functions are provided such as image compositing, cell size resampling, and cloud masking for Landsat-8 when computing indices.
 A simple structure of Rindcalc can be viewed in \autoref{fig:rindcalc}.

# Key Modules

* **`load_bands`**: 
  For each remote sensing product individual bands can be read as an array using the `load_bands` method.
  The method allows for index formulas to be applied with the imagery in the form of matrix calculations.
  Each index computed with Rindcalc only loads the neccisary bands through the `load_bands` method in order to reduce the memory size needed to compute each index.  
 
- **`composite`**:
  For remote sensing products three band composites of varying band combinations are important to highlight various features.
  Rindcalc provides a simple structure to create said composites as the band specification inputs use the naming convention standard within Rindcalc.

- **`index`**: 
  Index is not the name of this method but rather a placeholder where "index" is replaced by the name of the index to be calculated, e.g. `Landsat(in_path).NDVI()`. 
  The index method is the core of Rindcalc effectively automating the Input/Output (I/O) in the process to compute and calculate indices.
  Indices computed are output as an array to allow for easy integration with other Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Scikit-Image.
  Each index however, also possess to ability to save the output index as a GeoTIFF raster with corresponding spatial information to allow for its use in GIS.

- **`utils.resample`**:
  Resampling allows for matrix calculations to be computed between bands of different cell sizes. 
  The process to resample creates an in memory GDAL Virtual Dataset (VRT), a bytesize XML format file with the new xy resolution, in order to sidestep the need to write an intermediate file to a physical disk that could potentially slow the process down. 
  The newly resampled VRT is subsequently read as an array before being flushed from the memory.

# Custom Equations 

Rindcalc is purposefully kept modular and indices not available in Rindcalc can easily be implemented by the end user with Rindcalc acting as the I/O library with only a few lines of code as opposed to the many lines potentially required by other geospatial processing libraries.
An example of using Rindcalc to compute a user equation is as follows:

``` python
from rindcalc import Sentinel
from rindcalc.utils import save_index

# Intialize class and read all band paths into dictionary
data = Sentinel("path_to_img_dir")

# Load neccisary bands as arrays
bands = data.load_bands(["band_4", "band_8"])

# Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) array
ndvi = ((bands["band_8"] - bands["band_4"]) / 
	(bands["band_8"] + bands["band_4"]))

# Save the calculated NDVI array as a GeoTIFF retaining all 
# spatial information
save_index(ndvi, "output.tif", snap=data.path["band_4"])

```

While the example shown in \autoref{fig:output} is a simple calculation and can even be computed automatically with `Sentinel.NDVI()`, it shows that the I/O capabilities of Rindcalc can be used to simplify remote sensing workflows and adapt to a researchers needs beyond the equations offered.

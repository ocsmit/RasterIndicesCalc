**NAIP | rindcalc.naip**
========================

The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during
the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the
NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental
agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.

The default spectral resolution is natural color (Red, Green and Blue, or RGB)
but beginning in 2007, some states have been delivered with four bands of
data: RGB and Near Infrared `(USDA) <https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/>`_.
